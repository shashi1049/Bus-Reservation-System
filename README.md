# Bus-Ticket-Reservation-System

The main objective of this Bus Ticket Reservation System project is to build a system that will help a company to make an automatic ticket reservation system. For a large company, it is hard to keep on track of the overall process of ticket booking manually so having an automated system will save time and resources and provide an error-free solution to the company, and provides the means for expansion also.
